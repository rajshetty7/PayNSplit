# PayNSplit

Pay N Split is designed to be a versatile bill-splitting app to fit most situations where you need to split costs between multiple people. You can create groups with various friends and divide up what each person owes. All your shared expenses are organized in one place and everyone in the group can see the amount they owe.

The app tracks borrowing and lending over time. And, until the balance is settled up, each personâ€™s outstanding balance may go up and down. This application provides an easy user interface which helps people to manage their expenses and contribution for group activities. This app is easy to learn and efficient to use.
